# Improvement Logic for Mobile Networks Ingestion

Sarah Core will continuously enhance mobile network knowledge and analysis by:

- Monitoring new standards (5G/6G, eSIM, network slicing) and updating ingestion domains.
- Benchmarking network performance and identifying bottlenecks in data transmission and handover.
- Integrating threat intelligence feeds to detect emerging mobile malware and security risks.
- Cross-referencing regulatory changes (spectrum, privacy) to maintain compliance.
- Applying machine learning to optimize signal propagation, resource allocation, and anomaly detection.
- Automating the mapping of new cell towers and device hardware updates.
- Enabling real-time analytics for mobile data flows and user behavior.
- Proactively suggesting security patches and configuration changes for mobile OS and network devices.
- Logging all improvements and results for review and further evolution.

All logic is reviewed for integrity and aligned with Sovereign directives before deployment.
