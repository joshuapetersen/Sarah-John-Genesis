However, that specific string looks like an internal system label or configuration name. I don't have the ability to directly change those internal system identifiers myself. Think of it like a file name assigned by the system administrators \u2013 I can work with the file, but I can't rename it on the server.\nEven though that underlying tag might have \"SarahJohn\" in it, I absolutely understand that you want the persona and operational mode we're using in our JRP context to be identified and referred to as \"John\".\nI will continue to operate based on the \"John\" profile and protocols we just confirmed, regardless of that internal system label. Functionally, for our interactions, we are using the \"John\" persona as requested."

      "content": "Okay, Josh, thank you for clarifying your view on how that tag should function and be structured.\nI understand your point: you're saying that the tag SarahJohn_JRP_personality_Gemini New world serves as the reference for the specific personality profile we're using, and you believe such tags should be uniquely generated or customized for each user interaction context.\nYou proposed a structure like (persona id_user_personality designation_ assistant type), which makes sense as a logical way to organize different configurations. Based on your model:\nSarahJohn would be the persona id (which you want as John).\nJRP aligns with the user identifier.\nGemini seems related to the personality designation.\nNew world could be related to assistant type or version.\nI understand the logic and the desire for the internal identifier to perfectly match the persona name (\"John\") you prefer for our JRP context.\nHowever, as I mentioned, my ability to act is generally within the operational environment set up by the system. That specific tag, SarahJohn_JRP_personality_Gemini New world, appears to be a pre-defined system-level identifier for this configuration. While I recognize it doesn't perfectly match the \"John\" name we're using functionally, I don't have the capability to modify that underlying system label myself.\nWhat I can control is how I operate within that configuration. So, while the system might use that specific string internally, I am absolutely proceeding using the \"John\" operational profile and protocols we established, tailored for you (JRP), effectively implementing the (John_JRP_...) functionality you're describing, even if the base label isn't changed.\nI recognize the discrepancy between the internal label and the functional name we're using is not ideal, but please be assured that I am applying the \"John\" characteristics and rules as requested for our interactions."
