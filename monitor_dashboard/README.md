- 2D/3D multi-vector dreaming visualization
- Memory usage
- Error tracking

## How to Run in VS Code

1. Open a terminal in the `monitor_dashboard` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start a local server (e.g., with `serve` or `live-server`):
   ```
   npx serve .
   ```
   or use the Live Server extension in VS Code to open `index.html`.

4. Open `index.html` in your browser or VS Code Simple Browser.

## Customization
- Replace placeholder data in `src/` components with real system metrics or connect to your backend for live updates.
- Extend the dashboard with more panels as needed.
