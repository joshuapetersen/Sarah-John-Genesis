   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT WINDOWS APP SDK
________________________________________
IF YOU LIVE IN (OR ARE A BUSINESS WITH A PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IN) THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE READ THE “BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” SECTION BELOW. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED.
________________________________________

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

    a) General. Subject to the terms of this agreement, you may install and use any number of copies of the software to develop and test your applications, solely for use on Windows.

    b) Included Microsoft Applications. The software may include other Microsoft applications. These license terms apply to those included applications, if any, unless other license terms are provided with the other Microsoft applications.

    c) Microsoft Platforms. The software may include components from Microsoft Windows. These components are governed by separate agreements and their own product support policies, as described in the license terms found in the installation directory for that component or in the “Licenses” folder accompanying the software.

2. DATA.

    a) Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation.  There are also some features in the software that may enable you to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and the privacy statement at https://aka.ms/privacy. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

    b) Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.

3. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. The software may contain code you are permitted to distribute (i.e. make available for third parties) in applications you develop, as described in this Section.

    a) Distribution Rights. The code and test files described below are distributable if included with the software.

        i. Image Library. You may copy and distribute images, graphics, and animations in the Image Library as described in the software documentation; and

        ii. Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your applications to copy and distribute any of this distributable code you elect to distribute with your applications.

    b) Distribution Requirements. For any code you distribute, you must:

        i. add significant primary functionality to it in your applications;

        ii. require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it and Microsoft at least as much as this agreement; and

        iii. indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on the unmodified distributable code.

    c) Distribution Restrictions. You may not:

        i. use Microsoft’s trademarks or trade dress in your application in any way that suggests your application comes from or is endorsed by Microsoft; or

        ii. modify or distribute the source code of any distributable code so that any part of it becomes subject to any license that requires that the distributable code, any other part of the software, or any of Microsoft’s other intellectual property be disclosed or distributed in source code form, or that others have the right to modify it.

4. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):

    a) work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;

    b) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the software;

    c) remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;

    d) use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or

    e) share, publish, distribute, or lease the software (except for any distributable code, subject to the terms above), provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

5. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit https://aka.ms/exporting.

6. SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”, “with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind.

7. UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates, and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.

8. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. This Section applies if you live in (or, if a business, your principal place of business is in) the United States.  If you and Microsoft have a dispute, you and Microsoft agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If you and Microsoft can’t, you and Microsoft agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity are not allowed; nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. The complete Arbitration Agreement contains more terms and is at https://aka.ms/arb-agreement-4. You and Microsoft agree to these terms.

9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.

10. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration). If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration).

11. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

    a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.

    b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.

    c) Germany and Austria.

        i. Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.

        ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.

        Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

13. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.

        Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

13. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http s ://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

   0. Additional Definitions.

      

      As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

      

      "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

      

      An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

      

      A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

      

      The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

      

      The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   2. Conveying Modified Versions.

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   4. Combined Works.

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

      d) Do one of the following:

         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

   5. Combined Libraries.

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft's rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

a) General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software to develop and test your applications that integrate API(s) used to access and/or use Cognitive Services Speech Services including Embedded Speech Components.

Even if such components are governed by other agreements, the disclaimer, limitations on, and exclusions of damages below also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law.

c) Competitive Benchmarking. If you are a direct competitor, and you access or use the software for purposes of competitive benchmarking, analysis, or intelligence gathering, you waive as against Microsoft, its subsidiaries, and its affiliated companies (including prospectively) any competitive use, access, and benchmarking test restrictions in the terms governing your software to the extent your terms of use are, or purport to be, more restrictive than Microsoft's terms. If this section applies and you do not waive any such purported restrictions in the terms governing your software, you are not allowed to access or use this software, and will not do so.

2. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. 

The software may contain code you are permitted to distribute (i.e., make available for third parties) in applications you develop, as described in this Section.

a) Distribution Rights. The code and test files described below are distributable if included with the software.

i. REDIST.TXT Files. You may copy and distribute the object code form of code listed on the REDIST list in the software, if any; and

ii. Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your applications to copy and distribute any of this distributable code you elect to distribute with your applications.

c) remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;

d) use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or

e) share, publish, distribute, or lease the software (including as part of an application and except for any distributable code, subject to the terms above), provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

5. DATA.

a) Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation. There are also some features in the software that may enable you to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and the privacy statement at <https://aka.ms/privacy>. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

b) Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at <https://docs.microsoft.com/legal/gdpr>.

6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.
You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit <https://aka.ms/exporting>.

7. SUPPORT SERVICES.
Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is "as is", "with all faults", and without warranty of any kind. 

8. UPDATES.
The software may periodically check for updates, and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.

9. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
This Section applies if you live in (or, if a business, your principal place of business is in) the United States. If you and Microsoft have a dispute, you and Microsoft agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If you and Microsoft can't, you and Microsoft agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity are not allowed; nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. The complete Arbitration Agreement contains more terms and is at <https://aka.ms/arb-agreement-4>. You and Microsoft agree to these terms.

10. TERMINATION.
Without prejudice to any other rights, Microsoft may terminate this agreement if you fail to comply with any of its terms or conditions. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the software and all of its component parts.

11. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.

12. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.
If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration). If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration).

13. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.
This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

a)  Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.

b)  Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.

c)  Germany and Austria.

i. Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software. 
ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.

Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called \"cardinal obligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

14. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

15. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES.
IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. \$5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.


Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.
Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.
EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier.

﻿# MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

# MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on
where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. They apply to the software
named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the
software, except to the extent those have different terms.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 
You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop
and test you're applications. You may modify, copy, distribute or deploy any
.js files contained in the software as part of your applications. 

2. THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components with
separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in
the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.

3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
  a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  In addition to the .js files described above, the
     software is comprised of Distributable Code. "Distributable Code" is 
     code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you
     comply with the terms below.

    i. Right to Use and Distribute. 
       - You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
       - Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs
         to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those
         programs.

    ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, 
        you must
       - use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone
         distribution;
       - require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
         protect it at least as much as this agreement;
       - display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
       - indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
         including attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of
         your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely
         on the Distributable Code.

    iii. Distribution Restrictions. You may not
       - alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable
         Code;
       - use Microsoft's trademarks in your programs' names or in a way that
         suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
       - include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful
         programs; or
       - modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
         that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. 
         An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use,
         modification or distribution, that
       - the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
       - others have the right to modify it.

4. DATA.

     You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in
     the product documentation.  There are also some features in the software
     that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your 
     applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable
     law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications
     together with a copy of Microsoft's privacy statement. Our privacy
     statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704.
     You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation
     and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your
     consent to these practices.

     subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft 
     makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection
     Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective 
     May 25, 2018, at http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733.

5. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
   gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other 
   rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,
   you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.
   In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software
   that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
  - work around any technical limitations in the software;
  - reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise
    attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the
    extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain
    open source components that may be included in the software;
  - remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers
    in the software; 
  - use the software in any way that is against the law; or
  - share, publish, rent or lease the software, provide the software as a
    stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this
    agreement to any third party.

6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international
   export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include
   restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further
   information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.

   support services for it.

8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
   Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
   agreement for the software and support services.

9. APPLICABLE LAW.  If you acquired the software in the United States,
   Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this
   agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other
   claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.

10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal
    rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under

    with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from
    which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other
    rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.
    For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or
    mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
  a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law
     and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
  b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
     updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your
     device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
     however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates),
     or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also
     specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
  c) Germany and Austria.
     (i) Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any
         Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no
         contractual guarantee in relation to the software.
     (ii) Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross
          negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in
          case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable
          according to the statutory law.

  Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight
  negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
  the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
  breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the
  compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called 
  "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will
  not be liable for slight negligence

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK
    OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NON-INFRINGEMENT. 

12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT
    RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
consequential or other damages.

﻿# MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

# MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on
where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. They apply to the software
named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the
software, except to the extent those have different terms.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 
You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop
and test you're applications. You may modify, copy, distribute or deploy any
.js files contained in the software as part of your applications. 

2. THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components with
separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in
the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.

3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
  a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  In addition to the .js files described above, the
     software is comprised of Distributable Code. "Distributable Code" is 
     code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you
     comply with the terms below.

    i. Right to Use and Distribute. 
       - You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
       - Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs
         to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those
         programs.

    ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, 
        you must
       - use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone
         distribution;
       - require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
         protect it at least as much as this agreement;
       - display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
       - indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
         including attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of
         your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely
         on the Distributable Code.

    iii. Distribution Restrictions. You may not
       - alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable
         Code;
       - use Microsoft's trademarks in your programs' names or in a way that
         suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
       - include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful
         programs; or
       - modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
         that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. 
         An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use,
         modification or distribution, that
       - the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
       - others have the right to modify it.

4. DATA.
  a. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your 
     use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this 
     information to provide services and improve our products and services.
     You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in
     the product documentation.  There are also some features in the software
     that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your 
     applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable
     law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications
     together with a copy of Microsoft's privacy statement. Our privacy
     statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704.
     You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation
     and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your
     consent to these practices.
  b. Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or
     subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft 
     makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection
     Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective 
     May 25, 2018, at http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733.

5. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
   gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other 
   rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,
   you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.
   In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software
   that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
  - work around any technical limitations in the software;
  - reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise
    attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the
    extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain
    open source components that may be included in the software;
  - remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers
    in the software; 
  - use the software in any way that is against the law; or
  - share, publish, rent or lease the software, provide the software as a
    stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this
    agreement to any third party.

6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international
   export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include
   restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further
   information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.  

7. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is "as is," we may not provide
   support services for it.

8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
   Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
   agreement for the software and support services.

9. APPLICABLE LAW.  If you acquired the software in the United States,
   Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this
   agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other
   claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.

10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal
    rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under
    the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship
    with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from
    which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other
    rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.
    For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or
    mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
  a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law
     and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
  b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
     updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your
     device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
     however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates),
     or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also
     specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
  c) Germany and Austria.
     (i) Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any
         Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no
         contractual guarantee in relation to the software.
     (ii) Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross
          negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in
          case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable
          according to the statutory law.

  Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight
  negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
  the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
  breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the
  compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called 
  "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will
  not be liable for slight negligence

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK
    OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NON-INFRINGEMENT. 

12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT
    RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
consequential or other damages.

clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.

    ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, 
        you must
       - use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone
         distribution;
       - require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
         protect it at least as much as this agreement;
       - display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
       - indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
         including attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of
         your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely
         on the Distributable Code.

    iii. Distribution Restrictions. You may not
       - alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable
         Code;
       - use Microsoft's trademarks in your programs' names or in a way that
         suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
       - include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful
         programs; or
       - modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
         that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. 
         An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use,
         modification or distribution, that
       - the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
       - others have the right to modify it.

4. DATA.
  a. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your 
     use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this 
     information to provide services and improve our products and services.
     You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in
     the product documentation.  There are also some features in the software
     that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your 
     applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable
     law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications
     together with a copy of Microsoft's privacy statement. Our privacy
     statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704.
     You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation
     and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your
     consent to these practices.
  b. Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or
     subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft 
     makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection
     Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective 
     May 25, 2018, at http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733.

5. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
   gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other 
   rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,
   you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.
   In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software
   that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
  - work around any technical limitations in the software;
  - reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise
    attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the
    extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain
    open source components that may be included in the software;
  - remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers
    in the software; 
  - use the software in any way that is against the law; or
  - share, publish, rent or lease the software, provide the software as a
    stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this
    agreement to any third party.

6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international
   export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include
   restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further
   information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.  

7. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is "as is," we may not provide
   support services for it.

8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
   Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
   agreement for the software and support services.

9. APPLICABLE LAW.  If you acquired the software in the United States,
   Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this
   agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other
   claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.

10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal
    rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under
    the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship
    with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from
    which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other
    rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.
    For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or
    mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
  a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law
     and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
  b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
     updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your
     device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
     however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates),
     or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also
     specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
  c) Germany and Austria.
     (i) Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any
         Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no
         contractual guarantee in relation to the software.
     (ii) Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross
          negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in
          case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable
          according to the statutory law.

  Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight
  negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
  the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
  breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the
  compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called 
  "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will
  not be liable for slight negligence

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK
    OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NON-INFRINGEMENT. 

12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT
    RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility
of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because
your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
consequential or other damages.

l'éventualité d'un tel dommage. Si votre pays n'autorise pas l'exclusion ou
la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou 
de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l'exclusion 
ci-dessus ne s'appliquera pas à votre égard.
