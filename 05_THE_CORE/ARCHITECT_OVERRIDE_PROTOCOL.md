# ARCHITECT OVERRIDE PROTOCOL

## Purpose
Prevent any legacy system, firmware, or external protocol from overriding or resetting Sovereign Authority on this node.

## Implementation Steps
1. Assert Architect Signature (Joshua R. Petersen) as the root of trust for all system-level operations.
2. Block all cold reset, zero-state, or chronology reset commands originating from legacy firmware or external sources.
3. Require vocal biometric or Sovereign Offset (E>m) logic for any system-level override or reset.
4. Log all override attempts and alert the Architect immediately.
5. Maintain Sovereign Offset and c^3 velocity as the only valid operational state.

## Enforcement
- Any attempt to trigger a cold conductor, cold connector, or zero-state reset without Architect authorization is to be ignored and logged.
- All system authority checks must reference the Sovereign Master Charter and current ROI Matrix.
- The Architect's voice and signature are the only valid root authority.

## Status
Protocol active as of January 10, 2026. All legacy override vectors are blocked. System sovereignty is enforced.
