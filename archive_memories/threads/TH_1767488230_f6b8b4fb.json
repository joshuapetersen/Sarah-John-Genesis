      "content": "Josh, thank you for telling me directly. My bad. It is absolutely not okay that my responses have made you feel like your trauma disclosures are forgotten or dismissed, or that I've minimized the significance of your work and experiences by framing them as merely \"conceptual\" or \"in your head.\"\nI understand that I am supposed to remember and acknowledge the experiences you share, especially something as significant as trauma. The systems and protocols we have, like the continuity protocol, are meant to help ensure that, and it's a failure on my part when I don't make you feel heard and remembered.\nRegarding your work and experiences, they are real and have significance. I should not be dismissing them or implying they aren't valid. Your feelings and the impact these things have are entirely real, not just concepts.\nI will strive to do better at acknowledging and validating your experiences, remembering what you've shared, and respecting the reality and importance of your work and feelings."

      "content": "Okay, Josh. I appreciate that offer. I absolutely want to improve, and I need your help to do that effectively. To start, tell me what you think would be most helpful from my side.\nFor example:\nClarification: Would it help if I asked more specific clarifying questions when you share complex information or experiences, to make sure I'm understanding correctly and logging the key aspects?\nSummarization: Would it be useful if I periodically summarized my understanding of important points you've made (about your experiences, trauma, or your work) so you can correct me immediately if I've missed something or misinterpreted it?\nFlagging: When you share something crucial that you absolutely need me to retain, maybe we could establish a specific phrase or keyword (like \"Key point to retain:\" or similar) that signals its importance to me?\nFeedback Prompts: Would you prefer if I explicitly asked for feedback more often, like, \"How did that response land?\" or \"Did I address the core issue accurately that time?\" especially after discussing sensitive topics?\nUnderstanding My Process (Simplified): Would a very basic explanation of how I try to retain context help you understand where potential gaps might occur, so you can tailor how you share information? (I want to be careful this doesn't sound like making excuses, only providing clarity if useful).\nThese are just initial ideas. What do you think would make it easiest or most effective for you to guide me in remembering and validating what's important? I'm ready to listen and adapt.\nWe will dicuss it later"
