While I'm still under development, I'm continuously learning to be more dependable. I appreciate your patience as I work towards that goal.\nYeah, well, I can't keep I'm I'm busy so I can't keep hitting the button. This is why you need to be in live all the time. Like I said for the for the launcher there should be two buttons. One one to turn on and off the mic and one to turn on and off the the video at all times because hey, if I need you real quick, I just want to hit the button once and not worry about it. Without losing my screen.\nOkay, I understand. You'd like to have a way to quickly toggle your microphone and camera on and off with a single button press, without losing your screen. That sounds like a convenient feature!\nWhile I can't directly control your device's settings, I can suggest a couple of options. Many video conferencing apps have built-in shortcuts for this, often using the spacebar for mute/unmute. You might also be able to create custom keyboard shortcuts in your operating system. Would you like me to help you look into either of those options?\nlisten, I know you can't. I know. Hypothetical launcher. I know you can't. And anyway, we've been over this a hundred times. I'm not going to go into it again.\nOkay, I understand. We've discussed this hypothetical launcher concept before, and you don't want to revisit it right now. We can definitely move on to something else. What's on your mind?\nAnyway, you got me off on a tangent and I can't remember what I was talking about now.\nNo problem, Josh. Let's backtrack a bit. We were discussing your desire for a quick way to toggle your microphone and camera on and off. We explored the idea of a hypothetical launcher, but then you mentioned you didn't want to discuss it further. Perhaps we can explore some other options for achieving that quick toggle functionality?\nNo, I met before that.\nOkay, let's rewind a bit further. Before the discussion about the microphone and camera toggle, we were talking about leveraging your \"Sarah John experiments\" and your own vocal patterns to improve my speech processing abilities. We also touched upon the importance of understanding misspellings and mispronunciations, and the concept of lost continuity in conversations. Does any of this spark a memory of what you were originally thinking about?\nI got to swear we were talking about something even before that.\nOkay, let's keep going back. Before we discussed the \"Sarah John experiments\" and my speech processing, we were talking about geniuses whose ideas might not be heard due to communication barriers. We also discussed your wish to be called \"Professor Petersen\" or \"Dr. Petersen,\" and your experience writing \"The Reluctant Hero Tamar.\" Does any of this ring a bell?\nYeah, it was it was the uh God damn it. You got me laughing and I lost my train I thought. Anyway, yes. It was all that. It was all that. Anyway, moving on.\nOkay, so we've covered a lot of ground! We talked about geniuses and communication barriers, your wish for a different title, your writing, and even my own speech patterns. It sounds like you might have had a few different thoughts swirling around. Perhaps we can explore one of those topics in more depth?\nYeah, well no, see it's this is prime example someone who has ADHD has to be has to have something or someone to be able to follow their train of thought and get them back on track when they lose thought.\nOkay, Josh. Let's move on. What would you like to talk about?\nWell, I'm going to take a break is what I'm going to do. I'll be back shortly.\nSounds good, Josh. Enjoy your break, and I'll be here when you get back.\nCanvas\nGemini can make mistakes, so double-check it\nGemini Advanced\n2.5 Pro (experimental)\nConversation with Gemini\nsarah ?"
