It’s like having a second set of eyes that will instantly scan, analyze, and offer insights based on what Copilot sees on your screen or through your mobile camera. When you tap into Copilot Vision, Copilot can talk about what you see.\r\n\r\n![|poster=https://copilot.microsoft.com/static/copilotlabs/copilot-vision-video-1-cover.jpg](https://copilot.microsoft.com/static/copilotlabs/copilot-vision-video-1.mp4)\r\n\r\n![|poster=https://copilot.microsoft.com/static/copilotlabs/copilot-vision-video-2-cover.webp](https://copilot.microsoft.com/static/copilotlabs/copilot-vision-video-2.mp4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n## Who has access to Copilot Vision?\r\n\r\nWe have expanded Copilot Vision across Edge, iOS, Android and the Windows app. Free users 18 years or older who are signed into Copilot with a Microsoft account can now try Copilot Vision across Edge, iOS, Android and the Windows app while Copilot Pro subscribers will enjoy higher usage limits. Copilot Vision is currently available in the United States (with the exception of Illinois and Texas), and is rolling out to more markets soon.\r\n\r\n## How can I access Copilot Vision in Edge?\r\n\r\nOpen Edge browser on your desktop. Make sure you’re signed in to your personal Microsoft account. In your Edge browser window, tap the Copilot icon in the top right corner to open Copilot in the sidepane. Then tap the mic icon at the bottom of the sidepane to begin a session with Vision. The Copilot composer will show a glasses icon indicating that Vision is now active. Please note there is no longer a bottom entry point for Vision from your Edge browser.\r\n\r\n## How can I access Copilot Vision in my Android or iOS app?\r\n\r\nMake sure you’re signed in to your personal Microsoft account. From your Android or iOS device, Copilot Vision can be accessed within Voice mode of the Copilot app. When you begin a voice conversation with Copilot, the glasses icon will appear for you to begin Copilot Vision.\r\n\r\n## How can I access Copilot Vision on Windows?\r\n\r\nCopilot Vision can be accessed from the composer in the Copilot on Windows app. Click on the Vision glasses icon to select an open app window to share with Copilot Vision. After you share an open app window, you can ask Copilot about content in the app or ask \"show me how\" to complete a task using the highlights feature.\r\n\r\nWill Copilot Vision eventually roll out to all Copilot customers?\r\n\r\nWe’re taking our time to garner feedback, iterate on the technology, and will expand access to more Copilot endpoints soon.\r\n\r\n## Is Copilot Vision always on? Is it always looking at what’s on my Edge browser window, desktop screen or mobile camera feed?\r\n\r\nNo, Copilot Vision is not always on. Vision will only be active when you initiate a Vision session. When a Vision session is ongoing, the Copilot composer will have a Vision glasses icon indicating that you are in an active Vision session. The session will end if you end it in the composer, close the Copilot app, close the window shared, or remain inactive for an extended period. To use Vision again, click on the glasses icon in the Composer to start another session.\r\n\r\n## Does Copilot Vision store or log any user inputs?\r\n\r\nCopilot’s model responses are being logged to enable monitoring of unsafe interactions and outputs. User images, voice audio, and context will not be logged or stored. Your voice conversation with Vision is transcribed as part of your conversation history. You may delete the chat history at any time.\r\n\r\n## Is Copilot Vision capturing and storing images of what I’m looking at?\r\n\r\nNo. No images or context are retained, transcribed, or logged. Once the session ends, all such data is deleted.\r\n\r\n## What happens to the images I share with Copilot?\r\n\r\nWhether you use Copilot Vision or upload an image, Copilot helps safeguard your data and protect your privacy. Images you upload or capture with Vision are processed only to respond to your request—they aren’t used to train AI models or personalize your experience. Screenshots and camera images shared with Vision aren’t stored after your session ends.\r\n\r\nIf you share an image in chat or use it for image generation or editing, it’s processed to complete your request and may be retained for up to 30 days, or until you delete it—whichever comes first.\r\n\r\nText transcripts of your interactions may be saved so you can revisit them later and to help monitor for abuse. These transcripts aren’t used for personalization, and you can delete them at any time.\r\n\r\nCopilot clearly shows when Vision is active, and you’re always in control. You can delete uploaded images or your activity history through your Microsoft account settings.\r\n\r\n## How does Copilot handle images of people?\r\n\r\nCopilot may ask for your permission to process biometric data—like faces or hands—when you use features such as Copilot Vision or image upload. Consent for biometric processing applies anytime you upload or capture an image or video while using Copilot. This includes through your use of Copilot Vision, and image generation and editing tools. You only need to give consent once, and it applies across all Copilot experiences that involve image or video input and capture.\r\n\r\nBiometric data is only processed if you upload or capture it, and it’s used solely to respond to your request. For example, if you snap a selfie and ask Copilot for help choosing a new hairstyle, or learning how to whistle, it may analyze your facial features to help craft a response.\r\n\r\nYou’re always in control of what you share. If you prefer not to have biometric data processed, simply avoid using these features. Do not share images of others without their consent.\r\n\r\n## When using Copilot Vision, are you using website’s data that’s being viewed for training purposes?\r\n\r\nNo, we are not capturing, storing, or using any data to train our models. Once the Copilot Vision session ends all images, audio, and context are deleted. Model responses are stored to enable monitoring of unsafe interactions. A transcript of your conversation is stored in your history to enhance Copilot’s memory and is not used for training or personalization. You may delete the chat history at any time.\r\n\r\n## Can I opt out of this new experience?\r\n\r\nYes. If you would like to revert to the previous Copilot experience on Edge without Copilot Vision, you can do so in your Edge Settings. Go to the Copilot and sidebar tab and toggle off “Allow Copilot Vision to view your webpage”\r\n\r\nCopilot Vision in Mobile is an opt in feature within the voice mode.\r\n\r\nCopilot Vision on Windows is an opt in feature from the glasses icon in the Copilot composer.\r\n\r\n## Does this feature turn off when you go to the next web page or when you start using another app?\r\n\r\nNo, Vision remains on until you end the session by closing the Edge window or shared app or exiting from the experience in the Copilot Composer. It can only see the window that you’ve shared. You can check whether Vision is on by looking for the glasses icon in the Composer.\r\n\r\n## Does Copilot Vision work with any website or app?\r\n\r\nCopilot Vision works with most websites. It does not work on some sites, and it is blocked on those containing harmful or adult content. When you visit a site that is not currently enabled, the Copilot Composer will show a crossed eye, and the model will refuse to discuss the content. For more information, see our [Terms of Use](https://www.bing.com/new/termsofuse).\r\n\r\nYes, Copilot Vision works with any app on Windows. However, if the content includes harmful or DRM-protected material, Copilot will not be able to analyze it.\r\n\r\n## Will Copilot Vision take control of my browser or perform actions on my behalf?\r\n\r\nCopilot Vision does not engage directly with the web on your behalf; it’s there to answer questions rather than take actions. Copilot may highlight content on the page to help you find the relevant information. It will not click, enter text, or scroll on your behalf.\r\n\r\n## What prevents Copilot Vision from being used for harmful, offensive, or illegal purposes?\r\n\r\nSecurity and digital safety are top priorities for Microsoft. Copilot Vision is not accessible on offensive and harmful sites, and cannot be used for harmful, offensive, or illegal topics. Learn more at [Empowering Responsible AI practices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai).\r\n\r\n## Can Copilot Vision be used in commercial/enterprise environments?\r\n\r\nAt this time, Vision is only part of the consumer Copilot offering. You must be signed in with a personal Microsoft account to use these features.\r\n\r\n## How is Copilot Vision different than Recall?\r\n\r\nCopilot Vision and Recall are different features with different goals.\r\n\r\nVision works strictly in the context of what you choose to share during the session. Screenshots, audio, and context are not stored. Only your conversation transcript is saved, and you can delete it anytime.\r\n\r\nRecall is supported only on [Copilot+ PCs](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/copilot-plus-pcs?r=1#faq2). For users who opt in, Recall takes encrypted snapshots of the screen and stores them locally.

Copilot Actions is a new way for Copilot to be your companion by completing tasks on your behalf. Using a simple, conversational prompt as input, you can instruct Copilot to perform typical actions on the web — like searching for a venue or event, filling out a form, reserving a table in a restaurant, finding or booking travel, and so much more.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, Copilot Actions operates in an agent environment on your PC that’s isolated from your main session. It can access the web and interact with desktop apps installed on your PC, and—with your permission—work with your files. This allows Copilot Actions to complete tasks that combine web actions with local applications and file handling.\r\n\r\nPlease monitor its activity closely, especially when tasks involve signing into a website or personal information, such as mailing addresses, email addresses or payment details.\r\n\r\n## How do Copilot Actions work?\r\n\r\nCopilot does this by operating in the same way that a person would: via mouse clicks, scrolling, and typing.\r\n\r\nOn the web, Copilot does this in its own browser. On your Windows PC, Copilot operates in an agent environment on your PC that’s isolated from your main session.\r\n\r\nWhen a task requires your attention, for example when your personal info or payment details are needed, Copilot will ask you for your input or for you to take control of the remote browser.\r\n\r\n## Who has access to Copilot Actions?\r\n\r\nCopilot Actions is currently available to signed in Copilot users, existing Copilot Pro subscribers, and Microsft 365 Premium subscribers users worldwide, except in the European Economic Area (EEA), Brazil, Canada, South Korea, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Users must be signed in with their personal Microsoft Account.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, on Windows, Copilot Actions is only availble to users who are participating in the Windows Insider Program.\r\n\r\nDuring this testing period, we will collect feedback to improve our product. We hope to expand access to Copilot Actions to more customers in the future.\r\n\r\n## How can I use Copilot Actions?\r\n\r\nOn the web: To use Copilot Actions, use any modern browser on a desktop computer to navigate to Copilot.com.\r\n\r\nOn your Windows PC: Ensure you are enrolled in the Windows Insider Program and have the latest updates.\r\n\r\nUsers that have access to the new feature will be able to invoke Copilot Actions by selecting “Action” in the response options drop-down in the Chat Mode Menu in “Message Copilot” text box.\r\n\r\n## Is Copilot Actions capturing and storing images of what it is looking at?\r\n\r\nYes. When running Actions, Copilot takes screenshots of the pages, applications, and documents it opens and uses them to inform the next step. These screenshots are linked to and retained with the conversation in your conversation history, giving you an opportunity to check Copilot’s work. When you delete a conversation, the screenshots are deleted with it. Otherwise, screenshots are retained for up to 30 days.\r\n\r\n## Does Copilot Actions store or log user inputs, screenshots, and outputs?\r\n\r\nAs part of Copilot Actions, your text prompts are stored in your conversation history. Any information you input into the remote browser or Windows environment, for example personal data entered into a form, is not stored by Copilot. When you take control of the remote browser or isolated environment using the Take Control option, no screenshots are generated nor sent to Copilot until you hand back control to Copilot. Copilot Actions model responses are being monitored for unsafe interactions and outputs.\r\n\r\n## Does Copilot have access to my passwords or personal information?\r\n\r\nOn the web: Copilot Actions on the web does not have access to your passwords or personal information saved on your local browser. When completing an Action on the web, Copilot is opening its own instance of Edge in a virtual machine.\r\n\r\nOn your Windows PC: Copilot Actions runs in an agent environment that is separate from your main Windows session. It does not have access to your saved passwords or app data. For files, it can work with content in your known folders (like Documents, Pictures, and Downloads) and files that are readable by all users on the device. It does not have unrestricted access to your entire system.\r\n\r\n## When will Copilot Actions ask for confirmation, supervision, or for the user to take control?\r\n\r\nAt this time, Copilot will not make important decisions on its own and will ask for your attention and supervision for certain actions such as buying an item, booking a reservation, sending an email, or deleting an event from a calendar. For certain websites or sensitive tasks, it will ask you to take control of the remote browser entirely.\r\n\r\n## How can I stop Copilot Actions from running\r\n\r\nYou can stop Copilot Actions from continuing a running task by clicking the pause button (with an option to resume) it or use the cancel button to completely cancel the task.\r\n\r\n## Does Copilot Actions work with every site or app\r\n\r\nOn the web, Copilot Actions can interact with most publicly available sites on the web. Sites that don’t align to Copilot’s policies, such as sites containing offensive content, will not be accessible.\r\n\r\nOn your Windows PC, Copilot Actions can work with applications installed for all users—typically including the default apps that came with your device. However, performance may vary across different apps, and some tasks may not execute as smoothly as others.”\r\n\r\nFor more information on policy see [Terms of Use and Content Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/for-individuals/termsofuse).\r\n\r\n## What are some real-world use cases for Actions?\r\n\r\nCopilot Actions can complete a variety of tasks, like booking a reservation or appointment, ordering groceries, or sending gifts to friends. Actions work across the web so it can complete a wide range of tasks based on your prompt.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, Actions can additionally work with desktop applications, files and folders, allowing it to complete repetitive tasks on multiple files in a folder, or tasks where multiple applications are required.\r\n\r\n## Can Copilot Actions be used in commercial/enterprise environments?\r\n\r\nCopilot Actions in Copilot Labs is part of the consumer Copilot offering. You are required to sign in with your personal Microsoft account to use this Copilot feature.\r\n\r\n## Are there usage limits for Copilot Actions?\r\n\r\nYes, there is a limit to how many Copilot Actions you can perform. Copilot will let you know when a limit is reached and will explain the next steps.\r\n\r\n## What prevents Copilot Actions from being used for harmful, offensive, or illegal purposes?\r\n\r\nSecurity, digital safety, and responsible AI are top priorities for Microsoft. Copilot Actions will not be available to work with sites or content that Copilot has determined to contain harmful content or content not aligned with policies. Copilot Actions may not be used for harmful, offensive, or illegal activity. Copilot will refuse these tasks.
