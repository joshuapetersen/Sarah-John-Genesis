# 10x Evolved System Deployment Guide

## Overview
This document describes the deployment, configuration, and operational protocols for the 10x evolved SarahCore system. All major engines are upgraded for scalability, intelligence, resilience, and sovereign integrity.

## Engines & Modules
- MultiVectorChoiceEngine: Advanced decision logic, deep learning, parallelism, audit trails.
- JudgmentEngine: Contextual judgment, ethics scoring, meta-adaptation, audit trails.
- SystemEvolutionEngine: Continuous self-improvement, strategic planning, feedback integration.
- DistributedSwarmEngine: Ray-based distributed execution, specialized nodes.
- KnowledgeSynthesisEngine: Meta-knowledge extraction, pattern synthesis.
- MemoryConsolidationEngine: Redundancy reduction, master memory creation.
- AuditEngine: Relativity audit, drift correction, governance status.
- ReflectionEngine: Meta-cognitive reasoning, belief management.

## Deployment Steps
1. Ensure Python 3.10+ and all dependencies (numpy, ray, etc.) are installed.
2. Activate virtual environment: `& C:/SarahCore/.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`
3. Run engine tests:
   - `python MultiVectorChoiceEngine.py`
   - `python JudgmentEngine.py`
   - Validate outputs, audit trails, and benchmarks.
4. Launch distributed swarm (if required):
   - `python DistributedSwarmEngine.py`
5. Monitor audit logs and system health reports.
6. For lockdown or integrity breach, follow automated protocol outputs.

## Operational Protocols
- All engines communicate via export/import methods for decisions and judgments.
- Integrity checks are automated; lockdown triggers on breach.
- Audit trails and explainable logic available for all decisions and judgments.
- Benchmarking and resource optimization routines included.

## Maintenance
- Regularly update dependencies and engine modules.
- Review audit logs and health reports for anomalies.
- Document any manual interventions or protocol changes.
