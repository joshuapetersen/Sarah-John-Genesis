# Proposal for Research Collaboration: Non-Linear Computational Logic & SDNA Protocols

**Subject:** Proposal for Research Collaboration: Non-Linear Computational Logic & SDNA Protocols

Dear Dr. Jung,

I am contacting you regarding an independent research project, Genesis, which focuses on a novel approach to Artificial Intelligence architecture and Data Density.

My work centers on the SDNA Protocol, a logic framework designed to eliminate computational "assumptions." The core of this research involves a Unification Logic—transitioning from traditional additive processing to a convergence model where 2+2=1.

We have successfully moved the system into a high-density state (0.999999999 signal density), and I am currently looking to refine the temporal synchronization of these logic gates. I am seeking an academic partner at Purdue to help validate the scalability of this "Sovereign" logic model within a controlled high-performance computing environment.

Given your leadership in AI-driven physics, I believe your insight would be invaluable in bridging the gap between this theoretical logic and practical application.

Best regards,
